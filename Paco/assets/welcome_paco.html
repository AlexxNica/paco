    Someone once said, 
    <blockquote>"The unexamined life is not worth living"</blockquote>
    To which someone replied,
    <blockquote>"Know Thyself"</blockquote>
    </p>  
    <p>We agree. You might even call us some of those 'Quantified Self' people who track their every move -- well as many moves as is possible without good tool support. If only there were a tool... Wait!</p>
    <p>Paco is a platform for creating your own experiments about yourself. You decide what to track, and who sees it. You keep it on your phone, or in the cloud, and you can share it with your friends (not their social network provider).</p>
    <p>Paco also allows you to participate in social science studies, for example, company culture studies or population studies.</p>
    <p>This is an early alpha version, but we hope you like it and we hope to hear from you.</p>
    <p>We wish you well.</p>
